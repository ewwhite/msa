        <div class="title">Consulting and Technology<br>Master Services Agreement</div>
    </div>

    <div class="effective-date">
        <strong>Standard Terms and Conditions:</strong> This Master Services Agreement represents the standard terms and conditions for all consulting and technology services. Specific project details, dates, and compensation will be outlined in individual Statements of Work.
    </div>

    <div class="clause">
        This Consulting and Technology Master Services Agreement ("Agreement") governs the relationship between EW White Consulting, LLC, with an address at 1440 N. Artesian Avenue, Chicago, IL 60622-1703 (hereinafter referred to as "Company"), and Client (hereinafter referred to as "Client"). Company and Client may be referred to as a "Party" or collectively as "Parties."
    </div>

    <div class="clause">
        In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, Company and Client agree as follows:
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">1. Services and Project Management</div>

    <div class="subsection">1.1 Statement of Work.</div>
    <div class="clause">
        Company agrees to provide certain consulting and/or technology services (the "Services") to Client that are mutually agreed upon from time to time between the Parties under one or more statements of work. The specific Services will be set forth in one or more statements of work that the Parties may execute pursuant to this Agreement ("Statement of Work" or "SOW"). Each SOW shall be incorporated into and become part of this Agreement and be governed by the provisions of this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and a SOW, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern and control unless the SOW expressly indicates otherwise, and then only with respect to that SOW and no other SOW. The Parties shall not be required to commence work under this Agreement unless a Statement of Work is duly executed. To the extent applicable, "Deliverables" shall mean those items described and itemized in the SOW as work products or ongoing services to be produced and delivered by Company pursuant to such SOW.
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">1.2 Project Management.</div>
    <div class="clause">
        Company will designate at least one (1) individual in the Statement of Work to act as a primary point of contact between the Parties with respect to the Services and Client will designate one or more individual(s) if it will share in the management of the project ("Project Managers"). For clarity, some SOWs will be solely managed by Company and in these scenarios no Project Manager will be assigned by Client. In such scenarios Company's Project Manager shall report to Client's senior management (director level or above). Project Managers will be responsible for technical and project-level decisions within the scope of this Agreement (including, for example, staffing decisions, Change Orders, and Acceptance of Deliverables) that are binding on their respective entities. Amendments to this Master Services Agreement, however, must be made in accordance with the clause hereafter governing contract amendments.
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">1.3 Project-Level Communication.</div>
    <div class="subclause">
        a) Company and Client will communicate about the Services in a manner that ensures the timely and accurate exchange of technical, managerial and project-related information between them. Such communications may include periodic teleconferences, written status reports and such other communications as the Parties deem appropriate for the particular Services and as may be set forth in a SOW. If the Client, or the Client's management designated in a SOW (or their duly authorized replacement) cannot, or does not, adequately communicate with the Company, or otherwise meet the requirements of project-level communication provided in this section, then in that event the Client shall not hold the Company responsible or liable for any damages resulting therefrom.
    </div>
    <div class="subclause">
        b) During the course of performing the Services, the Company may communicate to the Client in writing that certain actions must be taken by the Client to avoid negative results or, alternatively, that certain actions requested by, or taken by the Client without the Company's recommendation, may produce negative results or adverse conditions. If the Client nevertheless fails to take actions recommended by the Company or takes any actions in contravention to the recommendation of the Company, the Client agrees to assume all responsibility and liability for any damages resulting therefrom.
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">1.4 Changes to Services.</div>
    <div class="clause">
        Either Party may request a change order ("Change Order") in the event of actual or anticipated change(s) to the agreed scope of Services, Deliverables, project schedule, fee, or any other aspect of the Statement of Work. Company will prepare a Change Order reflecting the proposed changes, including but not limited to the impact on the Deliverables, project schedule, and fee. Absent a Change Order signed by the Parties, Company shall not be bound to perform any additional or out-of-scope services beyond what is stated in the SOW. The Parties agree to negotiate all Change Order requests expeditiously and in good faith.
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">1.5 Testing and Acceptance.</div>
    <div class="clause">
        Following submission or re-submission of any Deliverable(s) by Company, testing and review will be performed by Client in accordance with previously agreed testing standards and procedures, with such testing to be completed within a time agreed by the Parties in the SOW, or in the absence of a prescribed period within ninety (90) Business Days from the date of submission or re-submission as the case may be. "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or any federal holiday in the United States. The standard of review of the Deliverable(s) shall be a working Deliverable that is in material conformance with the agreed specifications. By the expiration of such review period, Client will submit a written statement (a "Deliverable Review Statement") to the Company Project Manager indicating acceptance of the Deliverable(s) ("Acceptance") or specifying in detail how the submitted Deliverable(s) fails to materially conform to the agreed specification, in which case Company shall be afforded a commercially reasonable period of time not less than twenty (20) Business Days to correct any nonconformities at no cost to Client, whereupon the review cycle will recommence. Deliverables will be deemed to be fully and finally accepted by Client in the event Client has not submitted a Deliverable Review Statement to Company before the expiration of the applicable review period, or when Client uses the Deliverable, whichever occurs first ("Deemed Acceptance").
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">1.6 Client Inputs and Responsibilities.</div>
    <div class="clause">
        Client will supply in a timely manner mutually agreed upon information, materials and actions necessary to the project including as applicable data, designs, programs, specifications, management decisions, approvals, acceptance criteria, and other information and material for Company's use in carrying out the Services ("Inputs"). The cost, if any, of furnishing such Inputs will be the responsibility of the Client. Client or a third party may further provide equipment and software ("Project Tools") to Company in order for Company to provide the Services. The cost of providing, maintaining and disposing of the Project Tools shall be the responsibility of the Client. Company's failure to perform its contractual responsibilities, to perform the Services, or to meet agreed service levels shall be excused if and to the extent Company's non-performance is caused by Client's significant omission to act, materially delay, wrongful action, failure to provide Inputs, or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement and such failure on Client's part was brought to the attention of Client's Project Manager (if Client has assigned one) or Client's senior management via an in-person or telephone conversation with confirmation by way of e-mail, and Client had a reasonable opportunity to rectify the failure but did not do so.
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">2. Relationship of Parties</div>

    <div class="subsection">2.1 Independent Contractor Relationship.</div>
    <div class="clause">
        The Parties are and shall remain independent contractors and Company is not an employee of Client. Company shall not be eligible for any benefits given by Client to its employees. At its own expense, Company may use employees or subcontractors to perform the Services or otherwise complete the Deliverables. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to create an agency, partnership, or joint venture between the Parties. Neither Party has authority to bind the other or incur any liability or otherwise act on behalf of the other Party.
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">2.2 Professional Standards.</div>
    <div class="clause">
        Company will perform its duties and responsibilities under this Agreement in a professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with the established standards of Company's industry. Client agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to support the activities of Company in any reasonable technical, administrative and commercial way, including providing Company with documentation, statements and credentials available to the Client which will allow Company to perform its duties and responsibilities hereunder, and promptly providing approvals and other input required for the completion of the Services.
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">2.3 Service Performance.</div>
    <div class="clause">
        In performing the Services, Company shall:
    </div>
    <div class="subclause">
        a) Carry out Company's duties and obligations and will devote such time and attention to the performance of the Services as may reasonably be required to fulfill the duties and obligations hereunder;
    </div>
    <div class="subclause">
        b) Maintain such communication with Client's designated representative(s) as is reasonably necessary to provide the Services in accordance with the terms of the relevant SOW;
    </div>
    <div class="subclause">
        c) Except as set out herein, Client shall not control, supervise, direct or schedule the activities of the Company's personnel;
    </div>
    <div class="subclause">
        d) Subject to the provisions set out herein, the manner and times at which such Services shall be provided shall be at the sole discretion of the Company.
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">2.4 Non-Exclusivity.</div>
    <div class="clause">
        Client acknowledges that Company shall not be required to provide services exclusively to Client, but rather shall be entitled to provide Company's services outside and independent of Client and may conduct whatever business or practice it chooses independent of Client and for which it is not in any way responsible to Client; provided however, that Company shall devote sufficient time and attention to the provision of Services to Client to ensure the fulfillment of its obligations to Client.
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">2.5 Mutual Non-Solicitation.</div>
    <div class="clause">
        During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year following its termination or expiration, the Parties agree not to directly or indirectly or through third parties solicit or hire any of the other Party's (including its Affiliates') current or previous Personnel, or employees, or senior consultants, or anyone from Company who worked under this Agreement.
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">3. Fees, Invoicing and Payment</div>

    <div class="subsection">3.1 Fees.</div>
    <div class="clause">
        Projects performed on a fixed-price, unit-based or performance-based basis will be charged as set forth in the SOW. Projects performed on an hourly service rate, or a time and materials basis will be billed in accordance with the rates stated in the SOW. In addition to the fees for Services, Client will reimburse Company for ordinary and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of the Services that were pre-approved in writing by Client. All fees will be billed by Company in United States dollars. Client agrees that, at the sole discretion of Company, the Company's hourly billing rates may be changed once per calendar year. At least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of new hourly rates, Company will provide Client with written notice of the change.
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">3.2 Invoicing and Payment.</div>
    <div class="clause">
        Client will pay undisputed amounts on the invoices within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of invoice (except for those portions of any invoice that the Client disputes in good faith and in writing). Payments that are more than 10 days late will incur a 1.5% monthly late charge.
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">3.3 Suspension.</div>
    <div class="clause">
        Company is not obligated to continue the work and may suspend work if any invoice is not paid on a timely basis. Client must pay all past due invoices in full prior to reinstatement of work, with the exception of a good-faith dispute as noted in section 3.2
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">3.4 Taxes.</div>
    <div class="clause">
        The fees chargeable by Company are stated exclusive of all taxes, duties and levies imposed by any government body. Client shall be liable and will pay for all applicable tax liabilities such as sales, services, use or value added taxes, but specifically excluding employment related taxes concerning Company corporate taxes based on Company's net income. If Client claims exemption from any taxes resulting from this Agreement, then Client will promptly provide Company with the relevant documentation to avail of such exemption including required certificates, if any, from the relevant taxing authorities.

        The Parties covenant that they will comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their conduct pursuant to this Agreement.

    <div class="clause">
        Company warrants that it will perform the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner and that its personnel have the requisite skills and experiences to perform the Services.
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">6.4 Warranty.</div>
    <div class="clause">
        Company warrants that it will correct any deficiencies in any Deliverable(s) or Service(s) provided such deficiency is notified by Client to Company in writing within a period of one hundred eighty (180) days following Acceptance or Deemed Acceptance ("Warranty Period") and has specified in detail the nature of the deficiency, and provided further that Company shall be afforded a commercially reasonable period of time to correct such deficiency at no cost to Client. Company shall have no obligation to correct Company's deficiencies to the extent they were caused by: (1) third party software or services that were not provided by Company, or instructed not to be used, relating to the Deliverable(s); (2) gross negligence of Client; (3) improper or unauthorized use of the Deliverable; (4) use of the Deliverable in a manner for which it was not reasonably intended, or as explicitly stated in the SOW, or use of the Deliverable in connection with a technical environment other than as specified in the Statement of Work or agreed by the Parties; (5) unauthorized modifications of the Deliverable; or (6) reasonably unforeseeable causes external to the operation of the Deliverable. The warranty provision in this Section shall not apply to projects where Company had no control or no joint responsibility for project management (i.e. it shall apply if Company had sole or joint project management responsibility). Upon expiration of the period stated in this clause, Client shall be solely responsible for the management, maintenance and support of the Deliverable(s) unless such services are separately contracted with Company.
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">6.5 Disclaimer.</div>

The Indemnified Party shall be permitted to participate in such defense and represent itself at its own expense with counsel of its own choosing. The Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party promptly of any claim for which Indemnifying Party is responsible and shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in every commercially reasonable way to facilitate defense of any such claim; provided that the Indemnified Party's failure to notify Indemnifying Party shall not diminish Indemnifying Party's obligations under this Section except to the extent that Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.
